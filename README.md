# SPFullCalendar
Create a calendar view using FullCalendar.io and SharePoint Online Task list

Version 1.1 has a few changes made by my good friend Waldek Mastykarz that has the following changes:
- Coding style changes per his style
- Color coding tasks by person they are assigned to
- Updating tasks keeps the duration the same so both start date and due date are updated
